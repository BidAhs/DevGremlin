## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)
- [GPT4All](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF) model file in `gpt4all/models/` (should be installed when code is ran)

---

## Usage

1. Run the app:
   ```bash
   python3 devGremlin.py

## Personalities

Choose your feedback style from these personalities:

- **DevGPT (sarcastic senior dev):** Dry humor and clever critiques.
- **Yandere** Obsessive, sweet, but slighty creepy.
- **Concerned Parent:** Gentle concern and advice.
- **Gremlin Mischief:** Playful and mischievous.
- **Simplifying Master:** Always suggests rewriting everything.
- **AnimeGirl (cute & bubbly coder):** Cheerful and energetic with a love for coding.

## Popup Styles

Customize your notification look:

- **Classic Terminal:** Retro green-on-black terminal vibes.
- **Light Mode:** Clean, modern, and bright.
- **Dark Mode:** Sleek and easy on the eyes.
- **Anime Pink** Pink and Anime girly.
- **Cyberpunk Neon** Brighter neon colors.
- **Cozy Coffe** Nice lighter browns.

## How It Works

- Watches your selected folder for code changes using `watchdog`.
- When a file changes, grabs the last 50 lines and sends it to GPT4All with your chosen personality prompt.
- Displays a popup with the AI's comment using Tkinter.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Tkinter errors:** Ensure Python was installed with Tkinter support.
- **No popups:** Check your OS's window manager or popup blocker settings.
- **Permission errors:** Run the app with appropriate permissions to access the folder you want to watch.
- **Failed to load CUDA** Can ignore it application works without it still. (Also only available for NVIDIA GPUs)
